This dataset contains a timestamp and 25 signals of 8 different components. For example, L1 could be the current of a stepper motor and L2 the speed of that stepper motor. this data shows the process of a whole production plant. The process was run till failure. Thus intial readings of the dataset are classified as 0 and end failure classified as 1 (last 500 readings to be certain as per the author of the dataset).
