The Tennessee Eastman process is a typical industrial process that consists of five main process units: a two-phase reactor where an exothermic reaction occurs, a separator, a stripper, a compressor, and a mixer. This is a nonlinear open-loop unstable process that has been used in many studies as a case study for plant-wide control, statistical process monitoring, sensor fault detection, and identification of data-driven network models. 0 Classifies Normal 1 classifies Abnormal data.
